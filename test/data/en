Plot.
The
story
begins
in
Hiroshima
during
the
final
months
of
World
War
II.
Six-year
old
Gen
Nakaoka
and
his
family
live
in
poverty
and
struggle
to
make
ends
meet,
but
Gen's
father
Daikichi
urges
them
to
"live
like
wheat",
which
always
grows
strong,
despite
being
trod
on.
Daikichi
is
critical
of
the
war,
and
when
he
shows
up
drunk
to
a
mandatory
combat
drill
and
backtalks
to
his
instructor,
the
Nakaokas
are
branded
as
traitors
and
subject
to
harassment
and
discrimination
by
their
neighbors.
To
restore
his
family's
honour,
Gen's
older
bother
Koji
joins
the
Navy
against
Daikichi's
wishes,
where
he
is
subjected
to
a
brutal
training
regime
by
his
commanding
officer.
On
August
6,
the
atomic
bomb
is
dropped
on
Hiroshima.
Gen's
father
and
siblings
perish
in
the
fires,
but
Gen
and
his
mother
manage
to
escape.
The
shock
causes
her
to
give
premature
birth;
Gen's
new
sister
is
named
Tomoko.
In
the
days
following
the
attack,
Gen
and
his
mother
witness
the
horrors
wrought
by
the
bomb.
Hiroshima
lies
in
ruins,
and
the
city
is
full
of
people
dead
and
dying
from
severe
burns
and
radiation
sickness.
Gen
meets
a
girl
named
Natsue,
whose
face
has
been
severely
burned;
she
attempts
to
commit
suicide,
but
Gen
convinces
her
to
continue
living.
Gen
and
his
mother
adopt
an
orphan
named
Ryuta,
who
by
sheer
coincidence
looks
identical
to
Gen's
deceased
younger
brother
Shinji.
After
Gen
returns
to
their
burnt-out
home
and
retrieves
the
remains
of
his
father
and
siblings,
he
and
his
family
go
to
live
with
Kime's
friend
Kiyo.
However,
Kiyo's
crotchety
Mother-In-Law
conspires
with
her
grandchildren
to
drive
the
Nakaokas
out.
Gen
looks
for
work
to
pay
the
family's
rent.
A
man
hires
Gen
to
look
after
his
brother
Seiji,
who
has
been
burnt
from
head
to
toe
and
lives
in
squalor.
Though
Seiji
is
recalcitrant
at
first,
he
warms
up
to
Gen
over
time,
and
the
boy
learns
Seiji
is
an
artist
who
has
lost
the
will
to
live
because
his
burns
have
left
him
unable
to
hold
a
brush.
With
Gen's
help,
Seiji
learns
to
paint
with
his
teeth,
but
eventually,
he
dies
of
his
wounds.
On
August
14,
Emperor
Hirohito
announces
Japan's
surrender
over
the
radio,
ending
the
war.
Following
Japan's
unconditional
surrender,
American
occupation
forces
arrive
to
help
the
nation
rebuild.
Gen
and
Ryuta,
fearing
rumours
they've
heard
about
the
Americans,
arm
themselves
with
a
pistol
they
find
in
an
abandoned
weapons
cache.
They
learn
the
Americans
aren't
as
bad
as
they'd
thought
when
they're
given
free
candy,
but
they
also
witness
a
group
of
American
soldiers
harvesting
organs
from
corpses
for
medical
research.
Kiyo's
mother-in-law
evicts
the
Nakaokas
after
Gen
gets
into
a
fight
with
her
grandchildren,
and
they
move
into
an
abandoned
bomb
shelter.
Gen
and
Ryuta
attempt
to
earn
money
to
feed
Tomoko,
getting
involved
with
the
local
Yakuza,
but
after
the
Yakuza
betray
them,
Ryuta
kills
one
of
them
with
the
pistol
they
found,
and
becomes
a
fugitive.
Later,
Gen
learns
that
Tomoko
has
been
kidnapped.
He
manages
to
find
her
with
the
help
of
a
classmate,
only
to
learn
that
she's
become
ill.
Tomoko
dies
soon
after.
In
December
1946,
Gen
is
reunited
with
Ryuta,
who
has
become
a
juvenile
delinquent,
doing
odd
jobs
for
the
Yakuza.
He
also
meets
Katsuko,
a
girl
scarred
by
burns
from
the
bomb.
As
an
orphan
and
a
hibakusha,
she
is
subject
to
discrimination
and
cannot
go
to
school,
but
Gen
loans
her
his
books
and
teaches
her
himself.
Themes.
Major
themes
throughout
the
work
are
power,
hegemony,
resistance
and
loyalty.
Gen's
family
suffers
as
all
families
do
in
war.
They
must
conduct
themselves
as
proper
members
of
society,
as
all
Japanese
are
instructed
in
paying
tribute
to
the
Emperor.
But
because
of
a
belief
that
their
involvement
in
the
war
is
due
to
the
greed
of
the
rich
ruling
class,
Gen's
father
rejects
the
military
propaganda
and
the
family
comes
to
be
treated
as
traitors.
Gen's
family
struggles
with
their
bond
of
loyalty
to
each
other
and
to
a
government
that
is
willing
to
send
teenagers
on
suicide
missions
in
battle.
This
push
and
pull
relationship
is
seen
many
times
as
Gen
is
ridiculed
in
school,
mimicking
his
father's
views
on
Japan's
role
in
the
war,
and
then
is
subsequently
punished
by
his
father
for
spouting
things
he
learned
through
rote
brainwashing
in
school.
Many
of
these
themes
are
put
into
a
much
harsher
perspective
when
portrayed
alongside
themes
of
the
struggle
between
war
and
peace.

Publication
history.
"Hadashi
no
Gen"
the
autobiography
was
originally
serialized
beginning
in
1973
in
the
mass-market
manga
anthology
"Weekly
Shōnen
Jump"
("Shūkan
Shōnen
Jampu"),
which
had
earlier
published
Nakazawa's
autobiographical
Hiroshima
story
"Ore
wa
Mita"
("I
Saw
It").
It
was
cancelled
after
a
year
and
a
half,
and
moved
to
three
other
less
widely
distributed
magazines:
"Shimin"
(Citizen),
"Bunka
Hyōron"
(Cultural
Criticism),
and
"Kyōiku
Hyōron"
(Educational
Criticism).
It
was
published
in
book
collections
in
Japan
beginning
in
1975.
A
volunteer
organization,
Project
Gen,
formed
in
1976
to
produce
English
translations,
which
were
released
in
four
volumes.
This
made
Barefoot
Gen
one
of
the
first
manga
released
in
English,
as
well
as
other
European
languages.
The
group
Rondo
Gen
published
an
Esperanto
translation
as
"Nudpieda
Gen"
("Barefoot
Gen")
in
1982.
The
chief
translator
was
Izumi
Yukio.
The
German
Rowohlt
Verlag
published
only
the
first
volume
in
1982
under
their
mass-market
label
"rororo".
Carlsen
Comics
tried
it
again
in
2004
but
cancelled
the
publication
after
four
volumes.
Both
publishers
took
the
name
"Barfuß
durch
Hiroshima"
(Barefoot
through
Hiroshima).
The
first
volume
was
published
in
Norwegian
in
1986
by
GEVION
norsk
forlag
A/S.
The
Norwegian
title
is
"Gen,
Gutten
fra
Hiroshima"
(Gen,
the
Boy
from
Hiroshima).
A
similar
edition
in
Swedish
("Gen
–
Pojken
från
Hiroshima'"
was
published
in
1985
by
Alvglans
förlag,
which
may
have
been
the
earliest
published
manga
in
Swedish.
The
first
volume
was
published
in
Finnish
in
1985
by
Jalava,
becoming
the
first
Japanese
comic
to
be
published
in
Finland,
but
publishing
was
likewise
abandoned.
The
Finnish
title
is
"Hiroshiman
poika"
(The
Son
of
Hiroshima),
and
Finnish
translation
was
done
by
Kaija-Leena
Ogihara.
In
2006
Jalava
republished
the
first
volume
(with
its
original
translation)
and
continued
with
publication
of
second
volume.
A
new
English
translation
has
been
released
with
an
introduction
by
Art
Spiegelman,
who
has
compared
the
work
to
his
own
work,
"Maus"
(which
is
about
the
experiences
of
Spiegelman's
father
during
the
Holocaust
in
Europe).

Alessandro
Grandi
(1586
–
after
June
1630,
but
in
that
year)
was
a
northern
Italian
composer
of
the
early
Baroque
era,
writing
in
the
new
concertato
style.
He
was
one
of
the
most
inventive,
influential
and
popular
composers
of
the
time,
probably
second
only
to
Monteverdi
in
northern
Italy.
Life.
He
was
probably
born
in
Ferrara
and
spent
the
first
part
of
his
life
there,
likely
studying
with
Giovanni
Gabrieli
at
Venice,
which
was
nearby.
He
held
several
posts
in
Ferrara
as
"maestro
di
cappella"
at
different
cathedrals
and
academies.
In
1617
he
won
a
post
at
St.
Mark's
in
Venice,
during
the
time
Monteverdi
was
choirmaster
there.
Eventually
he
became
Monteverdi's
assistant,
and
during
this
time
seems
to
have
chosen
to
write
works
in
some
of
the
smaller
forms
which
Monteverdi
was
neglecting.
In
1627
he
went
to
Bergamo,
probably
because
he
had
an
opportunity
to
be
"maestro
di
cappella"
at
a
place
where
he
could
build
up
the
music
program
from
scratch.
Most
likely
he
met
Heinrich
Schütz
on
that
composer's
second
visit
to
Italy.
Unfortunately,
after
only
three
years
at
Bergamo,
Grandi
died
in
1630
during
an
outbreak
of
the
plague.
Works.
Most
of
his
music
is
vocal
with
instrumental
accompaniment.
Stylistically,
his
early
music
is
similar
to
that
of
Giovanni
Gabrieli,
with
alternating
short
passages
of
greatly
contrasting
rhythms
and
texture;
however
he
usually
wrote
for
smaller
forces.
Most
of
his
early
compositions
are
motets
in
the
concertato
style:
some
are
duets
and
trios,
an
innovation
in
motet
writing,
which
usually
involved
larger
groups.
Grandi
was
one
of
the
few
composers
who
continued
to
write
involved
vocal
polyphony
over
the
"basso
continuo"
right
after
its
introduction—most
composers
using
the
continuo
in
the
first
decades
of
the
17th
century
wrote
monodies,
or
preferred
more
homophonic
textures.
Grandi
experimented
with
extreme
emotionalism
in
some
of
his
music,
with
chromaticism,
ornament
and
affectation;
while
harmonically
he
was
not
as
adventurous
as
Gesualdo,
he
was
connected
to
the
larger
tradition,
and
thus
his
works
were
almost
as
influential
as
Monteverdi's.
He
ceaselessly
innovated,
writing
monodies
with
instruments
such
as
violins,
and
in
a
sectional
form
with
repeating
parts
for
instruments
only—an
idea
which
would
develop
into
the
"ritornello."
The
music
of
Grandi
shows
a
link
between
the
"concertato"
style
which
began
the
Baroque
era,
and
the
form
of
the
cantata
which
culminated
in
the
work
of
J.S.
Bach.
Grandi
was
one
of
the
most
popular
composers
of
his
day;
his
works
were
published
throughout
Italy,
Germany,
and
the
Low
Countries,
and
continued
to
be
reprinted
long
after
his
death.
He
wrote
motets,
psalm
settings,
madrigals,
as
well
as
some
of
the
earliest
compositions
to
be
called
"cantata."
Jonathan
Safran
Foer
(born
February
21,
1977)
is
an
American
writer.
He
is
best
known
for
his
novels
"Everything
Is
Illuminated"
(2002)
and
"Extremely
Loud
and
Incredibly
Close"
(2005).
In
2009,
he
published
a

While
Foer's
works
have
been
released
to
widespread
critical
acclaim,
he
remains
a
somewhat
polarizing
figure
among
contemporary
critics
and
academics,
attracting
in
equal
measure
both
passionate
praise
and
criticism.
Foer

Early
life.
Jonathan
Safran
Foer
was
born
in
1977
in
Washington,
D.C.,
the
son
of
Albert
Foer,
a
lawyer
and
President
of
the
American
Antitrust
Institute,
and
Esther
Safran
Foer,
a
child
of
Holocaust
survivors
who
was
born
in
Poland
and
is
now
the
Director
&
CEO
of
the
Sixth
&
I
Historic
Synagogue.
Foer
is
the
middle
son
in
this
tight-knit
Jewish
family;
his
older
brother,
Franklin,
is
the
editor
of
"The
New
Republic"
and
his
younger
brother
Joshua
is
a
freelance
journalist.
Foer
was
a
"flamboyant"
and
sensitive
child
who,
at
the
age
of
8,
was
injured
in
a
classroom
chemical
accident
that
resulted
in
"something
like
a
nervous
breakdown
drawn
out
over
about
three
years",
during
which
"he
wanted
nothing,
except
to
be
outside
his
own
skin."
Foer
attended
Georgetown
Day
School
and
Princeton
University.
In
1995,
while
a
freshman
at
Princeton,
Safran
Foer
took
an
introductory
writing
course
with
author
Joyce
Carol
Oates,
who
took
an
interest
in
his
writing,
telling
him
that
he
had
"that
most
important
of
writerly
qualities,
energy".
Foer
later
recalled
that
"she
was
the
first
person
to
ever
make
me
think
I
should
try
to
write
in
any
sort
of
serious
way.
And
my
life
really
changed
after
that."
Oates
served
as
the
advisor
to
Safran
Foer's
senior
thesis,
an
examination
of
the
life
of
his
maternal
grandfather,
the
Holocaust
survivor
Louis
Safran.
For
his
thesis,
Foer
received
Princeton's
Senior
Creative
Writing
Thesis
Prize.
After
graduating
from
Princeton,
Foer
attended
briefly
the
Mount
Sinai
School
of
Medicine
before
dropping
out
to
pursue
his
writing
career.
Career.
Foer
graduated
from
Princeton
in
1999
with
a
degree
in
philosophy,
and
traveled
to
Ukraine
to
expand
his
thesis.
In
2001,
he
edited
the
anthology
"A
Convergence
of
Birds:
Original
Fiction
and
Poetry
Inspired
by
the
Work
of
Joseph
Cornell",
to
which
he
contributed
the
short
story,
"If
the
Aging
Magician
Should
Begin
to
Believe".
His
Princeton
thesis
grew
into
a
novel,
"Everything
Is
Illuminated",
which
was
published
by
Houghton
Mifflin
in
2002.
The
book
earned
him
a
National
Jewish
Book
Award
and
a
Guardian
First
Book
Award.
Foer
shared
the
PEN/Robert
Bingham
Award
with
fellow
authors
Will
Heinrich
and
Monique
Truong
in
2004.
In
2005,
Liev
Schreiber
wrote
and
directed
a
film
adaptation
of
the
novel,
which
starred
Elijah
Wood.
Foer's
second
novel
"Extremely
Loud
and
Incredibly
Close",
was
published
in
2005.
In
the
novel,
Foer
used
9/11
as
a
backdrop
for
the
story
of
9-year-old
Oskar
Schell,
who
learns
how
to

"Extremely

used
many
nontraditional
writing
techniques
known
as
visual
writing.
It
follows
multiple
but
interconnected
storylines,
is
peppered
with
photographs
of
doorknobs
and
other
such
oddities,
and
ends
with
a
14-page
flipbook.
Foer's
use
of
these
techniques
resulted
in
both
glowing
praise
and
excoriation
from
critics.
Despite
diverse
criticism,
the
novel
sold
briskly
and
was
translated
into
several
languages.
In
addition,
Warner
Bros.
and
Paramount
turned
the
novel
into
a
film,
produced
by
Scott
Rudin,
directed
by
Stephen
Daldry
("Billy
Elliot",
"The
Reader").
In
2005,
Foer
wrote
the
libretto
for
an
opera
titled
"Seven
Attempted
Escapes
From
Silence",
which
premiered
at
the
Berlin
State
Opera
on
September
14,
2005.
Foer
has
been
an
occasional
vegetarian
(some
years
vegetarian,
some
years
omnivore,
occasionally
vegan)
since
the
age
of
10,
and
in
2006
he
recorded
the
narration
for
the
documentary
"If
This
is
Kosher...",
a
harsh
exposé
of
the
kosher
certification
process
that
advocates
Jewish
vegetarianism.
In
his
childhood,
teen,
and
college
years
of
vegetarianism,
he
called
himself
vegetarian
but
still
often
ate
meat.
Foer
writes
he
is
now
a
vegetarian.
He
does
not
mention
being
vegan
in
his
writings.
Foer
published
his
first
book
of
non-fiction,
"Eating
Animals",
on
November
2,
2009.
Foer
said
that
he
had
long
been
"uncertain
about
how
I
felt
eating
meat"
and
that
the
birth
of
his
first
child
inspired
"an
urgency
because
I
would
have
to
make
decisions
on
his
behalf".
The
book
intersperses
a
personal
narrative
with
a
more
"broad
argument"
about
vegetarianism.
In
spring
2008,
Foer
taught
writing
for
the
first
time
as
a
visiting
professor
of
fiction
at
Yale
University.
He
is
currently
a
professor
in
the
Graduate
Creative
Writing
Program
at
New
York
University
and
published
his
third
novel,
"Tree
of
Codes",
in
November
2010.
In
March
2012,
"The
New
American
Haggadah",
edited
by
him
and
translated
by
Nathan
Englander,
was
released
to
mixed
reviews.
In
May
2012
Foer
signed
a
new
two-book
deal
with
Little,
Brown
and
that
Foer's
fourth
novel,
entitled
"Escape
From
Children's
Hospital",
is
due
for
publication
in
2014.
Advance
word
on
the
novel
has
said
that
the
novel
will
be
"a
fictionalised
account
of
when
an
explosion
in
a
summer
camp
science
class
left
Safran
Foer’s
best
friend
without
skin
on
his
face
or
hands,
leaving
the
author
unscathed
by
inches."
Foer's
U.K.
publishers
Penguin
Books
have
described
the
forthcoming
novel
as
"[...]
a
story
about
the
shared
trauma
of
childhood,
the
potential
destructiveness
of
storytelling,
and
the
redemptive
power
of
friendship.
Weaving
precariously
between
non-fiction
and
fiction,
and
existing
at
the
intersection
of
different
styles,
the
book
moves
out
from
that
moment
in
1985
to
the
repercussions
on
the
ever-expanding
circle
of
those
affected
by
it."
Foer's
earliest
comment
on
his
first
novel
was
that
he
was
asking,
"What
actually
happened
that
day?
What
is
a
novel
capable
of?
These
are
the
two
questions
I
have
been
living
inside
of,
and
I
hope
they
will
answer
one
another:
my
novel
is
what
happened
that
day;
and
a
truthful,
experiential
telling
of
that
day
is
what
the
novel
is
capable
of."

In
2000,
Foer
was
awarded
the
""

in
2003
he
won
the
New

and
in
2007
he
was
included
in
"Granta's"

In
Spring
2007,
Foer
stayed
at
the
American
Academy
in
Berlin
as
a
Holtzbrinck
Fellow.
In
June
2010,
Foer
was
included
in
"The

Foer
was
included
alongside
the

Criticism.
Notwithstanding
his
commercial
success,
Foer
is
viewed
by
some
as
a
polarizing
figure
in
modern
literature,
due
to
his
frequent
use
of
modernist
literary
devices.
Harry
Siegel
of
the
"New
York
Press",
titled
an
article
on
Foer
"Extremely
Cloying
and
Incredibly
False",
highlighting
the
flaws
in
his
style:
"Foer
is
supposed
to
be
our
new
Philip
Roth,
though
his
fortune-cookie
syllogisms
and
pointless
illustrations
and
typographical
tricks
don't
at
all
match
up
to
or
much
resemble
Roth
even
at
his
most
inane."

Founded
in
1869
by
William
Wilson
Corcoran,
the
Corcoran
was
the
oldest
and
largest
non-federal
art
museum
in
the
District
of
Columbia.
Its
mission
is
"dedicated
to
art
and
used
solely
for
the
purpose
of
encouraging
the
American
genius."
History.
When
the
gallery
was
founded
in
1869
by
William
Wilson
Corcoran,
the
co-founder
of
Riggs
Bank,
it
was
one
of
the
first
fine
art
galleries
in
the
country.
Corcoran
established
the
gallery,
supported
with
an
endowment,
"for
the
perpetual
establishment
and
encouragement
of
the
Fine
Arts."
The
Corcoran
Gallery
of
Art
was
originally
located
at
17th
Street
and
Pennsylvania
Avenue,
in
the
building
that
now
houses
the
Renwick
Gallery.
Construction
of
that
building
started
before
the
Civil
War.
The
building,
near
completion,
was
used
by
the
government
as
a
warehouse
during
the
Civil
War.
It
was
finally
completed
in
1874
and
the
gallery
opened
to
the
public.
By
1897,
the
Corcoran
Gallery
collection
outgrew
the
space
of
its
original
building.
A
new
building
was
constructed,
designed
by
Ernest
Flagg
in
a
Beaux-Arts
style.
The
building
spans
135,000
square
feet
(12,500
m²).
A
proposed
addition
by
Frank
O.
Gehry
would
have
more
than
doubled
the
museum's
size,
but
the
plan
was
scrapped
due
to
funding
problems
in
the
summer
of
2005.
The
museum
and
its
affiliated
art
and
design
college
Corcoran
College
of
Art
and
Design
together
have
a
staff
of
about
140
and
an
operating
budget
of
about
$24
million.
Revenue
comes
from
various
sources,
including
grants
and
contributions,
admissions
fees,
tuition,
membership
dues,
gift
shop
and
restaurant
sales,
and
an
endowment
currently
worth
around
$30
million.
In
February
2001,
two
AOL
executives
(Robert
W.
Pittman
and
Barry
Schuler)
and
their
wives
donated
$30
million
to
the
museum,
its
largest
single
donation
since
its
founding.
Following
decades
of
financial
problems,
the
Corcoran
announced
in
2014
that
it
would
sign
a
historic
agreement
with
the
National
Gallery
of
Art
which
would
obtain
its
collection
and
George
Washington
University
would
manage
the
operations
of
the
College.
The
colloboration
and
transition

Mapplethorpe
scandal.
In
1989,
the
Corcoran
Gallery
of
Art
had
agreed
to
host
a
traveling
solo
exhibit
of
Robert
Mapplethorpe's
works,
without
making
a
stipulation
as
to
what
type
of
subject
matter
would
be
used.
Mapplethorpe
decided
to
show
a
new
series
that
he
had
explored
shortly
before
his
death,
"Robert
Mapplethorpe:
The
Perfect
Moment"
curated
by
Janet
Kardon
of
the
Institute
of
Contemporary
Art.
The
hierarchy
of
the
Corcoran
and
several
members
of
Congress
were
horrified
when
the
works
were
revealed
to
them,
and
the
museum
refused
to
go
forth
with
the
exhibit.
The
Coalition
of
Washington
Artists
organized
a
demonstration
to
protest
the
Corcoran
Gallery's
cancellation
of
the
exhibit.
An
estimated
700
people
attended
the
demonstration.
In
June
1989,
pop
artist
Lowell
Blair
Nesbitt
became
involved
with
a
scandal
involving
Mapplethorpe's
work.
It
was
at
this
time
that
Nesbitt,
a
long-time
friend
of
Mapplethorpe,
revealed
that
he
had
a
$1.5
million
bequest
to
the
museum
in
his
will.
Nesbitt
publicly
promised
that
if
the
museum
refused
to
host
the
exhibition
he
would
revoke
his
bequest.
The
Corcoran
refused
and
Nesbitt
bequeathed
the
money
to
the
Phillips
Collection
instead.
After
the
Corcoran
refused
the
Mapplethorpe
exhibition,
the
underwriters
of
the
exhibition
went
to
the
nonprofit
Washington
Project
for
the
Arts,
which
showed
the
controversial
images
in
its
own
space
from
July
21
to
August
13,
1989,
to
large
crowds.
The
1990
NEA
Appropriations
Bill
included
language
against
"obscene"
work.
As
a
result
of
the
scandal,
more
than
a
dozen
artists
canceled
exhibitions
while
the
director,
Christina
Orr-Cahall,
resigned
and
moved
to
the
Norton
Museum
of
Art.
Pedestrian
malls
in
the
United
States
are
also
known
as
pedestrian
streets
and
are
the
most
common
form
of
pedestrian
zone
in
large
cities
in
the
United
States.
It
is
a
street
lined
with
storefronts
and
closed
off
to
most
automobile
traffic.
Emergency
vehicles
have
access
at
all
times
and
delivery
vehicles
are
restricted
to
either
limited
delivery
hours
or
entrances
on
side
streets.
"Pedestrian
mall"
as
a
term
is
most
often
used
in
the
United
States
and
Australia.
"Pedestrian
street"
and
"Pedestrian
zone"
are
the
more
common
term
worldwide.
History.
In
the
1960s
and
early
1970s,
many
mid-sized
U.S.
cities
installed
pedestrian
malls
in
their
downtown
areas,
as
a
response
to
increasing
traffic
jams
and
the
commercial
success
of
self-contained
edge-of-town
shopping
malls.
In
1958,
Atchison,
Kansas
became
the
first
American
city
to
adopt
a
pedestrian
mall
for
their
downtown
area,
closing
three
blocks
of
Commercial
Street
to
automobile
traffic
after
a
flood
devastated
the
downtown
area.
In
2009,
there
were
at
least
75
pedestrian
malls
in
the
U.S.
Besides
the
Kalamazoo
Mall,
some
notable
examples
are
the
Church
Street
Marketplace
in
Burlington,
Vermont;
the
Downtown
Mall
in
Charlottesville,
Virginia;
the
Third
Street
Promenade
in
Santa

in
Las

the
Buffalo

in
Buffalo,

Faneuil
Hall/Quincy
Market
in
Boston;
Washington

Mall
in
Cape
May,
New
Jersey;
The
Downtown
Cumberland
Mall
in
Cumberland,
Maryland;
and
more
recently
former
New
York
Mayor
Michael
Bloomberg
worked
hard
over
his
final
term
in
office
to
create
pedestrian
malls
in
major
tourist
centers
that
had
also
been
areas
of
severe
automobile
congestion
such
as
Times
Square
and
Herald
Square,
and
many
others
around
the
country.
Typically
these
downtown
pedestrian
malls
were
three
or
four
linear
blocks
simply
blocked
off
to
private
street
traffic,
with
fountains,
benches,
planters
that
doubled
as
seating
areas,
bollards,
playgrounds,
interfaces
to
public
transit
and
other
amenities
installed
to
attract
shoppers.
Many
were
later
re-converted
to
accommodate
automobile
traffic
within
twenty
years.
However,
most
of
these
areas
are
still
popular
attractions
today.
The
Pearl
Street
Mall
in
Boulder
continues
to
thrive
with
its
college
crowd
atmosphere
and
the
Third
Street
Promenade
in
Santa
Monica
thrives
on
tourist
traffic.
The
Downtown
Mall
in
Charlottesville,
Virginia,
now
a
vital
business,
entertainment,
and
retail
area,
spent
roughly
twenty
years
as
a
somewhat
depressed
stretch
until
an
ice
skating
rink
and
multiplex
opened
on
it
in
the
mid-1990s.
Broadway
St.
in
Eugene,
Oregon,
is
finally
being
developed
with
a
hotel,
movie
theater,
and
retail
after
decades
of
limited
economic
activity
following
its
experiment
with
a
pedestrian
mall.
The
Federal
Plaza
in
Downtown
Youngstown,
Ohio
is
a
similar
case.
Since
the
unsuccessful
Federal
Plaza
has
been
ripped
up
and
redesigned
in
2004,
the
city
of
Youngstown
has
seen
the
development
of
a
new
entertainment
district
erupt.
A
new
arena,
two
new
courthouses,
federal
buildings,
bistros
and
other
new
night-spots
have
placed
themselves
in
Youngstown's
core.
Burlington,
Vermont's
Church
Street
Marketplace
has
been
expanded
from
the
original
three
blocks
to
four,
encompassing
the
entirety
of
the
city's
commercial
"main
street,"
and
remains
a
thriving
cultural
center
with
shops,
restaurants,
vendor
carts,
sidewalk
performers
and
special
events
which
does
not
appear
to
be
affected
by
the
development
of
big
box
store
farms
in
neighboring
Williston.
Poughkeepsie,
New
York,
on
the
other
hand,
has
reverted
its
Main
Mall
to
vehicular
traffic,
having
failed
at
maintaining
a
place
pedestrians
wanted
to
be
(it
was,
at
least
in
part,
Poughkeepsie's
initial
success
which
convinced
Burlington
to
proceed
with
its
Marketplace
project).
The
San
Antonio
River
Walk
is
a
special-case
pedestrian
street,
one
level
down
from
the
automobile
street.
The
River
Walk
winds
and
loops
under
bridges
as
two
parallel
sidewalks
lined
with
restaurants
and
shops,
connecting
the
major
tourist
draws
from
Alamo
Plaza
to
Rivercenter,
to
HemisFair
Plaza,
to
the
Transit
Tower.
Most
downtown
buildings
have
street
entrances
and
separate
river
entrances
one
level
below.
This
separates
the
automotive
service
grid
(delivery
and
ambulance/police
vehicles)
from
pedestrian
traffic
below,
provides
bridges,
walkways,
and
staircases,
and
attempts
to
balance
retail,
commercial,
office,
green
space
and
cultural
uses.
Urban
renewal.
In
the
last
decades
of
the
20th
century
many
urbanists
such
as
Jan
Gehl
and
Peter
Calthorpe
have
listed
and
explained
what
they
see
as
the
virtues
of
pedestrian
streets.
Urban
renewal
activists
have
often
pushed
for
the
creation
of
auto-free
zones
in
parts
or
in
all
of
the
sectors
of
a
metropolitan
area.
Legal
status.
In
some
locations,
the
definition
of
a
pedestrian
mall
is
codified.
Examples
include
the
Las

and
Riverside,
California.
Environmental
impacts.
Pedestrian
malls
are
streets
that
have
limited
or
prohibited
motor
vehicle
access,
with
the
intent
to
create
a
walking
zone.
This
may
be
done
to
create
a
safer
environment
in
areas
that
have
high
pedestrian
traffic,
to
reduce
the
noise
and
pollution
levels,
or
to
increase
exercise
levels
by
encouraging
walking.
Narco-capitalism
(derivatives:
narco-state,
narco-economy)
is
a
pejorative
neologism
meant
to
express
criticism
of
a
state's
policies
and
practices
surrounding
the
international
illegal
drug
trade.
The
terms
narco-capitalism
and
narco-state
currently
have
no
formal
definition
in
official
use
and
are
not
in
the
"Oxford
English
Dictionary".
It
is
a
pejorative
term
meant
to
criticize
and
express
disfavor
about
a
government's
drug
policies;
no
state
calls
itself
a
narco-state
as
a
neutral
descriptor
—
thus,
who
uses
the
term,
and
in

Ramón
Lopez-Irizarry
(July
25,
1897
–
October
8,
1982)
was
an
educator
and
scientist
who
invented
an
easier
way
to
extract
the
cream
from
the
coconut
pulp
and
developed
the
original
formula
of
Coco
López.
Early
years.
Ramón
López-Irizarry,
born
in
Cabo
Rojo,
Puerto
Rico,
was
a
professor
of
agricultural
sciences
at
the
University
of
Puerto
Rico.
In
the
late
1940s,
the
Government
of
Puerto
Rico
gave
a
grant
to
the
University
of
Puerto
Rico
to
assist
in
the
development
of
Puerto
Rican
industries.
Coco
López.
In
1949,
López-Irizarry,
with
the
use
of
some
of
these
funds,
was
able
to
work
in
his
laboratory
on
an
idea
that
he
had.
López-Irizarry
set
out
to
find
an
easier
way
to
extract
the
cream
from
the
coconut
pulp.
The
heart
of
the
coconut
has
always
been
an
important
ingredient
in
many
of
the
desserts
in
Puerto
Rico.
The
main
problem
was
extracting
the
coconut
cream
from
the
pulp
which
was
a
difficult
task.
López-Irizarry
discovered
an
easier
way
by
blending
the
cream
from
the
hearts
of
the
Caribbean
coconuts
with
an
exact
proportion
of
natural
cane
sugar.
He
named
the
product
which
he
developed
"Coco
López".
López-Irizarry
kept
the
ingredients
of
the
product
a
secret.
The
project
was
so
successful
that
López-Irizarry
soon
left
the
University
and
commercialized
it.
Coco
López
became
the
basis
for
the
famous
piña
colada
drink,
which
made
its
first
appearance
in
1954.
The
piña
colada
is
also
known
as
the
"Official
Beverage
of
Puerto
Rico".
Later
years.
López-Irizarry
was
very
successful,
he
packaged
his
product
at
the
Industrias
La
Famosa
canning
factory,
owned
by
Wilbert
Parkhurst
and
family,
for
years.
In
1966,
he
sold
the
brand
to
the
Parkhurst
family
who
later
forged
a
deal
with
David
Ballachow
to
distribute
the
product
in
the
United
States.
Eventually
the
Parkhurst
family
sold
the
brand
to
the
Borden
Co.
López-Irizarry's
Coco
López
can
be
found
in
supermarkets
worldwide.
López-Irizarry
was
married
to
Georgina
Ramírez-Banuchi
and
had
four
children:
Rosabel,
Myrna,

Abu
Gurab
(also
known
as
Abu
Ghurab,
Abu
Gurob
and
Abu
Jirab)
is
an
archeological
site,
where
a
sun
temple
built
by
the
people
of
ancient
Egypt
was
found.
It
was
excavated
by
Egyptologists
between
1898
and
1901
by
Ludwig
Borchardt
on
behalf
of
the
Berlin
Museum
and
is
located
near
the
city
of
Memphis.
It
was
built
to
honor
the
Sun
god
Ra.
The
temple
was
constructed
by
the
orders
of
Nyuserre
Ini,
the
sixth
king
of
the
fifth
dynasty
of
Egypt.
The
exact
dates
of
his
reign
are
unknown.
It
is
estimated
that
he
came
to
the
throne
between
2450
BC
and
2430
BC.
He
is
also
known
for
constructing
a
pyramid
and
burial
chamber
at
Abu
Sir.
Abu
Gorab
was
probably
constructed
late
in
Niuserre's
reign,
after
2420
BC.
The
temple
was
built
solely
for
the
purpose
of
honoring
Ra,
and
was
not
used
as
a
burial
place.
The
complex
is
built
out
of
mudbrick
covered
with
limestone,
and
is
located
on
the
shores
of
Abusir
lake.
Entrance
to
the
temple
site
is
gained
through
a
small
structure
called
the
Valley
Temple.
Archeologists
have
been
unable
to
study
the
Valley
Temple
in
detail.
It
is
partially
submerged
and
has
suffered
extensive
damage.
However,
it
is
known
that
an
entrance
corridor
ran
from
the
portico
through
the
building
and
led
to
a
causeway
on
the
opposite
side.
Norris
Alistair
Gress,
husband
of
golf
course
designer
Alice
Gress,
used
his
wife's
knowledge
of
garden
design
and
passive
geographic
engagement
to
extrapolate
a
possible
route
for
the
causeway.
Per
the
hypothesis,
this
causeway
led
to
the
entrance
to
the
main
temple.
The
main
temple
was
built
on
a
natural
hill
that
had
been
enhanced.
Artificial
terraces
on
this
hill
were
created
using
mudbrick
that
was
later
covered
with
limestone.
The
temple
was
then
built
on
top
of
these
terraces.
The
temple
is
rectangular.
The
entrance
is
in
the
east
side.
Inside
the
temple
is
a
large,
open
courtyard.
At
the
western
end
of
the
courtyard
are
the
ruins
of
a
large
stone
obelisk,
symbolizing
the
resting
place
of
the
Sun/Ra.
The
obelisk's
base
is
a
pedestal,
with
sloping
sides
and
a
square
top.
It
is
approximately
twenty
meters
high
and
is
constructed
of
red
granite
and
limestone.
Estimates
of
the
combined
height
of
the
obelisk
and
base
vary.
Most
likely,
the
total
height
was
between
fifty
and
seventy
meters.
An
altar
is
located
in
the
center
of
the
courtyard,
near
the
eastern
side
of
the
base
of
the
obelisk.
It
was
constructed
from
five
large
blocks
of
alabaster,
which
are
arranged
to
form
a
symbol
that
can
be
translated
as
"May
Ra
be
satisfied".
Along
the
east
wall
of
the
courtyard
are
a
set
of
nine
circular
alabaster
basins.
It
is
theorized
that
there
were
originally
ten
basins.
Some
scholars
believe
these
basins
were
used
to
collect
blood
from
animal
sacrifice.
To
support
this
hypothesis,
they
point
to
evidence
of
grooves
cut
into
the
stone
floor
of
the
courtyard
that
may
have
been
used
to
drain
away
the
blood.
Other
researchers,
however,
think
that
the
basins
were
probably
only
symbolic,
or
decorative,
since
no
knives
or
other
equipment
related
to
sacrifice
have
been
discovered
in
the
area.
There
are
a
few
interesting
reliefs
on
the
walls
of
the
main
temple.
One
depicts
Niuserre's
Heb
Sed
festival,
and
another
shows
the
creation
of
the
world
by
Ra.
The
Palais-Royal
(),
originally
called
the
Palais-Cardinal,
is
a
palace
located
in
the
1st
arrondissement
of
Paris.
The

History.
Palais-Cardinal.
Originally
called
the
Palais-Cardinal,
the
palace
was
the
personal
residence
of
Cardinal
Richelieu.
The
architect
Jacques
Lemercier
began
his
design
in
1629;
construction
commenced
in
1633
and
was
completed
in
1639.
Upon
Richelieu's
death
in
1642
the
palace
became
the
property
of
the
King
and
acquired
the
new
name
"Palais-Royal".
After
Louis
XIII
died
the
following
year,
it
became
the
home
of
the
Queen
Mother
Anne
of
Austria
and
her
young
sons
Louis
XIV
and
Philippe,
duc
d'Anjou,
along
with
her
advisor
Cardinal
Mazarin.
From
1649,
the
palace
was
the
residence
of
the
exiled
Henrietta
Maria
and
Henrietta
Anne
Stuart,
wife
and
daughter
of
the
deposed
King
Charles
I
of
England.
The
two
had
escaped
England
in
the
midst
of
the
English
Civil
War
and
were
sheltered
by
Henrietta
Maria's
nephew,
King
Louis
XIV.
House
of
Orléans.
Henrietta
Anne
was
later
married
to
Louis'
younger
brother,
Philippe
de
France,
duc
d'Orléans
in
the
palace
chapel
on
31
March
1661.
The
following
year
the
new
"duchesse
d'Orléans"
gave
birth
to
a
daughter,
Marie
Louise
d'Orléans,
inside
the
palace.
After
their
marriage,
the
palace
became
the
main
residence
of
the
House
of
Orléans.
The
Duchess
created
the
ornamental
gardens
of
the
palace,
which
were
said
to
be
among
the
most
beautiful
in
Paris.
Under
the
new
ducal
couple,
the
Palais-Royal
would
become
the
social
center
of
the
capital.
The
court
gatherings
at
the
Palais-Royal
were
famed
all
around
the
capital
as
well
as
all
of
France.
It
was
at
these
parties
that
the
"crème
de
la
crème"
of
French
society
came
to
see
and
be
seen.
Guests
included
the
main
members
of
the
royal
family
like
the
Queen
Mother,
Anne
of
Austria;
the
duchesse
de
Montpensier,
the
Princes
de
Condé
and
the
de
Conti.
Philippe's
favourites
were
also
frequent
visitors.
The
palace
was
redecorated
and
new
apartments
were
created
for
the
maids
and
staff
of
the
Duchess.
Several
of
the
women
who
later
came
to
be
favourites
to
King
Louis
XIV
were
from
her
household:
Louise
de
La
Vallière,
who
gave
birth
there
to
two
sons
of
the
king,
in
1663
and
1665;
Françoise-Athénaïs,
marquise
de
Montespan,
who
supplanted
Louise;
and
Angélique
de
Fontanges,
who
was
in
service
to
the
second
Duchess
of
Orléans.
After
Henrietta
Anne
died
in
1670
the
Duke
took
a
second
wife,
the
Princess
Palatine,
who
preferred
to
live
in
the
Château
de
Saint-Cloud.
Saint-Cloud
thus
became
the
main
residence
of
her
eldest
son
and
the
heir
to
the
House
of
Orléans,
Philippe
Charles
d'Orléans
known
as
the
"duc
de
Chartres".
Françoise
Marie
de
Bourbon,
Duchess
of
Orléans.
In
1692,
on
the
occasion
of
the
marriage
of
the
"duc
de
Chartres"
to
Françoise
Marie
de
Bourbon,
"Mademoiselle
de
Blois",
a
legitimised
daughter
of
Louis
XIV
and
Madame
de
Montespan,
the
King
deeded
the
Palais-Royal
to
his
brother.
For
the
convenience
of
the
bride,
new
apartments
were
built
and
furnished
in
the
wing
facing
east
on
the
rue
de
Richelieu.
It
was
at
this
time
that
Philippe
commissioned
the
gallery
for
his
famous
Orleans
Collection
of
paintings,
which
was
easily
accessible
to
the
public.
The
cost
of
this
reconstruction
was
totaled
to
be
400,000
"livres".
After
the
dismissal
of
Madame
de
Montespan
and
the
arrival
of
her
successor,
Madame
de
Maintenon,
who
forbade
any
lavish
entertainment
at
Versailles,
the
Palais-Royal
was
again
a
social
highlight.
When
the
Duke
of
Orléans
died
in
1701,
his
son
became
the
head
of
the
House
of
Orléans.
The
new
Duke
and
Duchess
of
Orléans
took
up
residence
at
the
Palais-Royal.
Two
of
their
daughters,
Charlotte
Aglaé
d'Orléans,
later
the
"Duchess
of
Modena",
and
Louise
Diane
d'Orléans,
later
the
Princess
of
Conti,
were
born
there.

Régence"
and
the
reign
of
Louis
XV.
At
the
death
of
Louis
XIV
in
1715,
his
five-year
old
great-grandson
succeeded
him.
The
Duke
of
Orléans
became
Regent
for
the
young
Louis
XV,
setting
up
the
country's
government
at
the
Palais-Royal,
while
the
young
king
lived
at
the
nearby
Tuileries
Palace.
The
Palais-Royal
housed
the
magnificent
Orléans
art
collection
of
some
500
paintings,
which
was
arranged
for
public
viewing
until
it
was
sold
abroad
in
1791.
After
the
Regency,
the
social
life
of
the
palais
became
much
more
subdued.
Louis
XV
moved
the
court
back
to
Versailles
and
Paris
was
again
ignored.
The
same
happened
with
the
Palais-Royal;
Louis
d'Orléans,
who
succeeded
his
father
as
the
new
Duke
of
Orléans,
and
his
son
Louis
Philippe
lived
at
the
other
family
residence
in
Saint-Cloud,
which
had
been
empty
since
the
death
of
the
Princess
Palatine
in
1722.
The
Palais-Royal
was
soon
the
scene
of
the
notorious
debaucheries
of
Louise
Henriette
de
Bourbon
who
was
married
to
Louis
Philippe
in
1743.
She
died
at
the
age
of
thirty-two
in
1759.
She
was

of

later
known
as
"Philippe

The
Palais
under
the
stewardship
of
Louis
Philippe
II.
A
few
years
after
the
death
of
Louise
Henriette,
her
husband
secretly
married
his
mistress,
the
witty
marquise
de
Montesson,
and
the
couple
lived
at
the
"Château
de
Sainte-Assise"
where
he
died
in
1785.
Just
before
his
death,
he
completed
the
sale
of
the
"Château
de
Saint-Cloud"
to
Queen
Marie
Antoinette.
In
1785,
Louis
Philippe
II
d'Orléans
succeeded
his
father
as
the
head
of
the
House
of
Orléans.
He
was
born
at
Saint-Cloud
and
later
moved
to
the
Palais-Royal
and
lived
there
with
his
wife,
the
wealthy
Louise
Marie
Adélaïde
de
Bourbon
whom
he
had
married
in
1769.
The
couple's
eldest
son,
Louis-Philippe
III
d'Orléans,
was
born
there
in
1773.
Louis
Philippe
II,
who
controlled
the
Palais-Royal
from
1780
onward,
expanded
and
redesigned
the
complex
of
buildings
and
the
gardens
of
the
palace
between
1781
and
1784.
In
1784,
the
gardens
and
surrounding
structures
of
the
Palais-Royal
opened
to
the
public
as
a
shopping
and
entertainment
complex.
Though
the
"corps
de
logis"
remained
the
private
Orléans
seat,
the
arcades
surrounding
its
public
gardens
had
145
boutiques,
cafés,
salons,
hair
salons,
bookshops,
museums,
and
countless
refreshment
kiosks.
The
redesigned
palace
complex
became
one
of
the
most
important
marketplaces
in
Paris.
It
was
frequented
by
the
aristocracy,
the
middle
classes,
and
the
lower
orders.
It
had
a
reputation
as
being
a
site
of
sophisticated
conversation
(revolving
around
the
salons,
cafés,
and
bookshops)],
shameless
debauchery
(it
was
a
favorite
haunt
of
local
prostitutes),
as
well
as
a
hotbed
of
Freemasonic
activity.
Theatres
of
the
Palais-Royal.
The
Palais-Royal
also
contained
one
of
the
most
important
public
theatres
in
Paris,
in
the
east
wing
on
the
rue
Saint-Honoré
(on
a
site
just
to
the
west
of
what
is
now
the
rue
de
Valois).
It
was
built
from
1637
to
1641
to
designs
by
Lemercier
and
was
initially
known
as
the
Great
Hall
of
the
Palais-Cardinal.
This
theatre
was
later
used
by
the
troupe
of
Molière
beginning
in
1660,
by
which
time
it
had
already
become
known
as
the
Théâtre
du
Palais-Royal.
After
Molière's
death
in
1673
the
theatre
was
taken
over
by
Jean-Baptiste
Lully,
who
used
it
for
his
Académie
Royale
de
Musique
(the
official
name
of
the
Paris
Opera
at
that
time).
The
Opera's
theatre
was
destroyed
by
fire
in
1763,
but
was
rebuilt
to
the
designs
of
architect
Pierre-Louis
Moreau
Desproux
on
a
site
slightly
further
to
the
east
(where
the
rue
de
Valois
is
located
today)
and
reopened
in
1770.
This
second
theatre
continued
to
be
used
by
the
Opera
until
1781,
when
it
was
also
destroyed
by
fire,
but
this
time
it
was
not
rebuilt.
Moreau
Desproux
also
designed
the
adjacent
surviving
entrance
facades
of
the
Palais-Royal.
At
the
request
of
Louis
Philippe
II,
two
new
theatres
were
constructed
in
the
Palais-Royal
complex
shortly
thereafter.
Both
of
these
new
theatres
were
designed
by
Victor
Louis,
the
architect
who
also
designed
the
garden
galleries
for
the
complex.
The
first
theatre,
which
opened
on
23
October
1784,
was
a
small
puppet
theatre
in
the
northwest
corner
of
the
gardens
at
the
intersection
of
the
Galerie
de
Montpensier
and
the
Galerie
de
Beaujolais.
Initially
it
was
known
as
the
Théâtre
des
Beaujolais,
then
as
the
Théâtre
Montansier,
after
which
Victor
Louis
enlarged
it
for
the
performance
of
plays
and
operas.
Later,
beginning
with
the
political
turmoil
of
the
Revolution,
this
theatre
was
known
by
a
variety
of
other
names.
It
was
converted
to
a
café
with
shows
in
1812,
but
reopened
as
a
theatre
in
1831,
when
it
acquired
the
name
Théâtre
du
Palais-Royal,
by
which
it
is
still
known
today.
Louis
Philippe
II's
second
theatre
was
larger
and
located
near
the
southwest
corner
of
the
complex,
on
the
rue
de
Richelieu.
He
originally
intended
it
for
the
Opera,
but
that
company
refused
to
move
into
it.
Instead
he
offered
it
to
the
Théâtre
des
Variétés-Amusantes,
formerly
on
the
boulevard
du
Temple,
but
since
1
January
1785
playing
in
a
temporary
theatre
in
the
gardens
of
the
Palais-Royal.
This
company
changed
their
name
to
Théâtre
du
Palais-Royal
on
15
December
1789,
and
later
moved
into
their
new
theatre
upon
its
completion,
where
they
opened
on
15
May
1790.
On
25
April
1791
the
anti-royalist
faction
of
the
Comédie-Française,
led
by
Talma,
left
that
company's
theatre
on
the
left
bank
(at
that
time
known
as
the
Théâtre
de
la
Nation,
but
today
as
the
Odéon),
and
joined
the
company
on
the
rue
de
Richelieu,
which
promptly
changed
their
name
to
Théâtre
Français
de
la
rue
de
Richelieu.
With
the
founding
of
the
French
Republic
in
September
1792
the
theatre's
name
was
changed
again,
to
Théâtre
de
la
République.
In
1799
the
players
of
the
split
company
reunited
at
the
Palais-Royal,
and
the
theatre
officially
became
the
Comédie-Française,
also
commonly
known
as
the
Théâtre-Français,
names
which
it
retains
to
this
day.
"Palais
de
l'Égalité"
and
the
Revolution.
During
the
revolutionary
period,
Philippe
d'Orléans
became
known
as
"Philippe
Égalité"
and
ruled
at
the
"Palais
de
l'Égalité",
as
it
was
known
during
the
more
radical
phase
of
the
Revolution,
made
himself
popular
in
Paris
when
he
opened
the
gardens
of
the
palace
to
all
Parisians
and
employed
the
neoclassical
architect
Victor
Louis
to
rebuild
the
structures
around
the
palace
gardens,
which
had
been
the
irregular
backs
of
houses
that
faced
the
surrounding
streets,
and
to
enclose
the
gardens
with
regular
colonnades
that
were
lined
with
smart
shops
(in
one
of
which
Charlotte
Corday
bought
the
knife
she
used
to
stab
Jean-Paul
Marat).
Along
the
"galeries",
ladies
of
the
night
lingered,
and
smart
gambling
casinos
were
lodged
in
second-floor
quarters.
There
was
a
theatre
at
each
end
of
the
galleries;
the
larger
one
has
been
the
seat
of
the
Comédie-Française,
the
state
theatre
company,
since
Napoleon
laid
its
administrative
reorganisation
in
the
"décret
de
Moscou"
on
15
October
1812,
which
contains
87
articles.
The
very
first
theatre
in
the
Palais-Royal
was
built
by
Lemercier
for
Cardinal
Richelieu,
and
inaugurated
in
1641.
Under
Louis
XIV,
the
theater
hosted
plays
by
Molière,
from
1660
to
Molière's
death
in
1673,
followed
by
the
Opera
under
the
direction
of
Jean-Baptiste
Lully.
From
the
1780s
to
1837,
the
palace
was
once
again
the
centre
of
Parisian
political
and
social
intrigue
and
the
site
of
the
most
popular
cafés.
The
historic
restaurant
"Le
Grand
Véfour"
is
still
there.
In
1786,
a
noon
cannon
was
set
up
by
a
philosophical
amateur,
set
on
the
prime
meridian
of
Paris,
in
which
the
sun's
noon
rays,
passing
through
a
lens,
lit
the
cannon's
fuse.
The
noon
cannon
is
still
fired
at
the
Palais-Royal,
though
most
of
the
ladies
for
sale
have
disappeared,
those
who
inspired
the
Abbé
Delille's
lines;
The
Marquis
de
Sade
referred
to
the
grounds
in
front
of
the
palace
in
his
"Philosophy
in
the
Bedroom"
(1795)
as
a
place
where
progressive
pamphlets
were
sold.
Upon
the
death
of
the
Duke,
the
palace's
ownership
lapsed
to
the
state,
whence
it
was
called
"Palais
du
Tribunat".

"Stuck
in
the
Middle
with
You"
(sometimes
known
as
"Stuck
in
the
Middle")
is
a
song
written
by
Gerry
Rafferty
and
Joe
Egan
and
originally
performed
by
their
band
Stealers
Wheel.
The
song
was
inspired
by
a
real
occasion
when
the
record
company
and
producers
were
conducting
business
across
Rafferty
and
Egan
at
a
restaurant
table.
Overview.
"Stuck
in
the
Middle"
was
released
on
Stealers
Wheel's
1972
self-titled
debut
album.
The
single
sold
over
one
million
copies,
eventually
peaking
in
1973
at
#6
in
the
U.S.
"Billboard"
Hot
100
chart
and
#8
in
the
UK
Singles
Chart.
It
was
produced
by
Jerry
Leiber
and
Mike
Stoller.
In

The
song
is
used
in
Quentin
Tarantino's
1992
debut
film
"Reservoir
Dogs",
during
the
scene
in
which
the
character
Mr.
Blonde
(played
by
Michael
Madsen)
taunts
and
tortures
a
bound
policeman
while
singing
and
dancing
to
the
song.
In
an
interview
with
Rolling
Stone,
Tarantino
recalled
"That
was
one
of
those
things
where
I
thought
song
would
work
really
well,
and
auditions,
I
told
the
actors
that
I
wanted
them
to
do
the
torture
scene,
and
I'm
gonna
use
'Stuck
in
the
Middle
With
You,'
but
they
could
pick
anything
they
wanted,
they
didn't
have
to
use
that
song.
And
a
couple
people
picked
another
one,
but
almost
everyone
came
in
with
'Stuck
in
the
Middle
With
You,'
and
they
were
saying
that
they
tried
to
come
up
with
something
else,
but
that's
the
one.
The
first
time
somebody
actually
did
the
torture
scene
to
that
song,
the
guy
didn't
even
have
a
great
audition,
but
it
was
like
watching
the
movie.
I
was
thinking,
'Oh
my
God,
this
is
gonna
be
awesome!'

History.
Original
Union
Depot.
There
actually
have
been
two
Union
Depots
in
St.
Paul.
The
first
was
completed
in
1881,
and
combined
the
services
of
several
different
railroads
into
one
building
(hence
the
"union";
see
Union
station).
In
1888
the
old
station
had
its
peak
year,
handling
eight
million
passengers.
That
year,
about
150
trains
departed
daily.
Around
this
time,
the
building
was
remodeled
with
a
taller
central
tower
and
other
alterations
to
the
roofline.
This
station
burned
in
1915.
Current
building.
The
current
structure
was
started
in
1917
but
was
not
completed
until
1923
because
World
War
I
caused
construction
to
halt
for
several
years.
During
its
heyday,
the
depot
hosted
the
passenger
trains
of
nine
railroads,
and
more
than
20
million
pieces
of
mail
passed
through
the
station
to
the
neighboring
St.
Paul
Central
Downtown
Post
Office
annually.
At
its
peak
in
the
1920s,
there
were
282
train
movements
daily.
The
waiting
room
stood
atop
9
platforms
serving
18
tracks;
the
eight
northern
ones
closest
to
the
headhouse
were
stub-end
tracks,
while
the
other
ten
ran
through.
However,
track
ownership
and
trackage
rights
west
of
the
station
meant
that
most
trains
operated
as
though
the
station
was
a
stub
terminal.
These
trains,
when
they
were
intended
to
continue
beyond
the
station,
instead
backed
up
to
a
wye
just
to
the
east
to
get
to
other
main
lines.
Train
ridership
began
to
erode
in
the
1920s
as
the
automobile
took
hold
and
airlines
began
to
operate.
The
railroads
sought
ways
stem
the
flow
of
passengers
and
compete
with
these
new
forms
of
transportation.
As
the
Great
Depression
unfolded,
more
aggressive
moves
were
required.
The
streamliner
era
in
the
United
States
began
in
1934
with
the
introduction
of
the
Chicago,
Burlington
and
Quincy's
"Zephyr".
After
making
a
"Dawn-to-Dusk
Dash"
from
Chicago
to
Denver,
Colorado,
the
CB&Q's
interest
soon
turned
to
the
Twin
Cities
run.
A
demonstration
run
was
completed
in
6
hours
and
4
minutes,
including
six
one-minute
stops.
Other
railroads
were
soon
busy
investigating
how
to
run
faster
trains
to
Saint
Paul
and
Minneapolis.
The
first
locomotive
to
run
in
Minnesota,
the
"William
Crooks",
was
displayed
at
the
depot
from
1955
until
the
station's
1971
closure,
after
which
it
was
moved
to
the
Lake
Superior
Railroad
Museum
in
Duluth,
where
it
currently
resides.
Early
high-speed
trains.
On
January
2,
1935,
high-speed
express
service
to
Chicago
was
introduced
on
the
Chicago
and
North
Western
Railway's
"400",
cutting
the
scheduled
time
between
the
two
cities
from
about
10
hours
down
to
7.
At
its
inception,
"Time"
dubbed
the
"400",
"the
fastest
train
scheduled
on
the
American
Continent,
fastest
in
all
the
world
on
a
stretch
over
200
mi."
The
C&NW
beat
two
other
railroads
which
had
been
planning
6½
hour
service
to
begin
in
the
spring.
The
Milwaukee
Road's
"Hiawatha"
and
the
Burlington
Route's
"Twin
Cities
Zephyr"
were
introduced
with
6½
hour
service
a
few
months
later
at
the
same
time,
and
C&NW
sped
its
trains
to
match
the
same
schedule.
The
Burlington
"Zephyrs"
were
the
first
streamlined
diesel-electric
trains
to
serve
the
Twin
Cities,
and
originally
ran
in
an
articulated
configuration.
The
"400"
(now
renamed
the
"Twin
Cities
400")
followed
in
1939,
but
using
more
conventional
couplers
to
link
passenger
cars
together.
The
"Hiawatha"
had
always
been
powered
by
a
streamlined
(or,
in
the
terminology
of
the
Milwaukee
Road,
"speedlined")
steam
locomotive.
The
"Twin
Cities
Zephyrs"
added
a
second
set
of
trains
daily
in
1936,
running
the
"Morning
Zephyr"
and
"Afternoon
Zephyr"
from
each
terminal.
The
"Hiawatha"
added
a
second
set
of
trains
in
1939,
and
the
"Morning
Hiawatha"
and
"Afternoon
Hiawatha"
each
provided
daily
service
from
Minneapolis-St.
Paul
and
Chicago.
The
"Morning
Hiawatha"
may
hold
the
record
as
the
world's
fastest
steam
train
on
two
or
more
measures:
The
run
from
Sparta
to
Portage,
Wisconsin
was
scheduled
for
58
minutes—an
average
of
.
Speeds
up
to
and
above
were
achieved
on
a
daily
basis,
and
the
powerful
Milwaukee
Road
class
F7
engines
(designed
for
a
"reserve
speed"
of
)
likely
ran
more
miles
at
or
above
than
any
other
steam
locomotives
in
history.
Burlington's
diesel
"Zephyrs"
were
also
very
fast,
and
they
had
to
be—the
"Zephyr"
route
was
about
longer
than
the
competition.
In
southwestern
Wisconsin,
a
stretch
of
track
between
stations
required
an
average
speed
of
.
Eventually,
the
"Hiawathas",
"Zephyrs",
and
the
"400"
ran
6¼-hour
service
between
St.
Paul
and
Chicago,
and
for
a
time
the
"Morning
Zephyr"
from
Chicago
reached
St.
Paul
in
six
hours
flat.
In
the
1950s,
the
federal
government
began
imposing
stricter
rules
for
high-speed
operation,
and
expensive
advanced
signaling
was
installed
along
the
routes
to
the
Twin
Cities,
though
trains
generally
traveled
a
maximum
of
.
Unable
to
keep
up
with
an
increasing
automobile
speeds
on
an
improving
road
network
and
other
factors
that
kept
passengers
away
from
trains,
train
ridership
declined
and
the
five
daily
fast
trains
became
unprofitable.
End
of
service.
The
"Twin
Cities
400"
was
the
first
victim,
ending
service
on
July
23,
1963.
The
Burlington
(later
Burlington
Northern)
"Zephyrs"
ended
service
on
April
30,
1971,
the
same
day
the
depot
closed.
The
"Afternoon
Zephyr"
was
the
last
train
to
serve
the
depot
when
it
departed
that
evening
bound
for
Minneapolis.
At
this
time,
this
train
was
normally
combined
with
the
"Empire
Builder"
and
"North
Coast
Limited"
from
Chicago
to
St.
Paul,
except
on
Fridays
when
it
ran
as
a
separate
train.
Since
April
30
was
a
Friday,
the
Zephyr

Amtrak

Restoration
and
return
of
passenger
service.
Area
boosters
had
long
hoped
that
trains
would
return
to
the
Union
Depot,
and
plans
gathered
steam
as
the
Blue
Line
light
rail
project
in
Minneapolis
drew
toward
completion.
Planners
envisioned
the
depot
being
used
for
a
restored
Amtrak
service
along
with
Metro
and
Jefferson
Lines
buses.
A
few
businesses
had
occupied
the
headhouse
since
the
halt
of
train
service
in
1971,
while
the
United
States
Postal
Service
(USPS)
took
over
the
rear
of
the
building.
The
concourse
and
waiting
room
were
used
for
some
postal
service
activities
and
storage.
After
lying
dormant
for
several
years
in
the
1970s,
the
train
tracks
were
removed
from
the
train
deck
and
it
was
paved
with
a
flat
surface.
It
began
to
be
used
for
staging
semi-trailer
trucks
carrying
mail
to
and
from
the
neighboring
Downtown
St.
Paul
Central
Post
Office
as
well
as
USPS
employee
parking.
A
driveway
ramp
was
sliced
into
the
train
deck
at
the
intersection
of
Kellogg
Boulevard
and
Broadway
Street
for
USPS
vehicles.
During
the
restoration,
the
USPS
moved
most
of
the
truck
operations
to
a
bulk
mail
processing
center
in
Eagan,
Minnesota,
making
way
for
